# 4Herons-genome-anno
We are very sorry that because our four herons' genome used two prefixes in the gene locus_tag (Scaffold number+Order), the Table2asn cannot merge the genome fasta and gff files. The annotation files (gff cds pep eggnog-annotation) can be visited from the following links. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me!
